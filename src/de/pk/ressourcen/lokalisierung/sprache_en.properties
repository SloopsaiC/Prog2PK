neulingDialogText=New here?\nDon't worry, we have prepared this beginner mode especially for you\nand whispered to the opponents that they shouldn't be too hard on you.\nTo get a good start in the game, your special attacks have a shorter cooldown\nand all enemies only hold back for you.\nIf you should go despite the puppy protection once too carelessly to the thing and die\nis also for this the decay time shortened.\n\nSo, go crazy and get to know the fascinating world of Iava! 
dickkopfDialogText=The beginner mode is not for you?\nYou'd rather have your head through the wall?Then this is the right mode for you!\nEverything is normal here, your opponents treat you like an adult,\nand your cooldowns are the same as they should be for a thickhead.\nBut that's not to be forgotten, in this game mode your opponents will drop better items\nwhen they scream in fear and go down in front of you!\n\nSo, do you dare? 
draufgaengerDialogText=Oha!\nYou've got a real go-getter in you? Are you ready to push yourself to the limit\nand to collect big winnings if you succeed?Great, then go to go-getter mode.\nBut beware, your opponents don't understand any fun anymore\nand are trying to make your life hell!\nAnd as if that weren't enough, your cooldowns have been prolonged,\nafter all, you are a professional or not?\n\nSo use your attacks wisely and fights in the team, then this challenge should be feasible even for you! 
blutduersterDialogText=One of this kind...\nWell, we've got the right one for you, too.\nThis is the hardcore mode, but don't worry, your opponents can't get much more powerful.\nThe enemies and cooldowns are the same as in the draufger mode.\nStill, think long and hard what you're doing here!\nThere is no mercy, if you die you lose all your things,\nwhich your friends can't collect for you, too, and you should keep in mind that\nif you and your friends die at the same time, that Dungeon is lost and you have to start again at Dungeon One.\n\nScared?
